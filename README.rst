Apart from that, you can enable ambient color and revolution and other configurations to make it more interesting. Just following the instruction of the menu you see as soon as you run this program.

Environment
-----------

* Windows
Window is recommend and you need to configure OpenGL environment if you want to compile this source file. I've added an executive file in debug and you can check its effection.

* Linux & MacOSX
Since glaux is used in this program, Linux and MacOSX is not available. However, you can use an alternative image loading component for glaux at http://www.videotutorialsrock.com/opengl_tutorial/particle_system/home.php. This website is really helpful.
